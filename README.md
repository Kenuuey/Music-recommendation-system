# Recommender systems. Music recommendations

This project introduces algorithms used for recommendation: non-personalized, content-based, and collaborative filtering

# Introduction

Recommendation systems simplify decision-making by guiding users toward relevant content or products, just as people historically relied on friends, family, or popularity indicators like bestsellers. They benefit users by reducing cognitive effort and offering trusted suggestions, while also benefiting businesses through increased engagement, cross-selling, and revenue growth. This mutual value makes recommender systems essential to modern digital products.

**Types of Recommendation systems:**

1. **Non-Personalized** recommenders show the **same suggestions to everyone**, regardless of individual preferences or history. Instead of tailoring recommendations to a specific person, they rely on **aggregate data** such as popularity or trends.
2. **Content-based** recommenders suggest items that are **similar to items the user already liked**, based on item features (descriptions, attributes, metadata).
3. **Collaborative filtering** recommends items by analyzing **user behavior** (ratings, clicks, purchases). The idea is that users with similar preferences in the past will like similar things in the future.
4. **Matrix factorization** is an advanced collaborative filtering technique. It reduces the large user-item interaction matrix into two smaller matrices that capture **latent factors** (hidden features). These factors represent underlying dimensions, such as genres, themes, or user preferences.
